      p I’m an aspiring web developer who loves everything about the web. I've lived in New York most of my life and have worked in lots of different jobs. It is a fast paced eviornment that has taught me to always keep learning and moving forward.
      My many hobbies include soccer, drawing, playing the guitar, and spending time with my friends and family. I am an adventurous person that loves the outdoors, but also doesnt mind staying at home watching movies.
